This project has been migrated from a Next.js web application to a Godot Engine project. The original web-related files have been removed, and a new Godot project has been initialized.

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open the Godot Engine editor.
3.  Click on "Import" and select the `project.godot` file from this repository.
4.  Click the "Run" button (or press F5) to start the game.
